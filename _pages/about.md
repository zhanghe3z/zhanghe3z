I am a first-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/" target="_blank">Oxford VGG</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://chrirupp.github.io/" target="_blank">Christian Rupprecht</a>, funded by <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/fees-funding-and-scholarship-search/scholarships-a-z-listing" target="_blank">Oxford-DeepMind Graduate Scholarship</a>.

Previously, I was a research intern at <a href="https://www.antgroup.com/en" target="_blank">Ant Research</a>, mentored by Dr. <a href="https://xuenan.net/" target="_blank">Nan Xue</a>. I was also fortunate to receive research guidance from Prof. <a href="https://justimyhxu.github.io/" target="_blank">Yinghao Xu</a> and Dr. <a href="https://shenyujun.github.io/" target="_blank">Yujun Shen</a>. During summer, I had the privilege to collaborate with Dr. <a href="https://justimyhxu.github.io/" target="_blank">Yinghao Xu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/" target="_blank">Gordon Wetzstein</a> from Stanford University. I got my M.Eng in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/" target="_blank">Zhejiang University</a> in 2025, where I was privileged to work closely with Prof. <a href="https://pengsida.net/" target="_blank">Sida Peng</a> and Prof. <a href="https://xzhou.me/" target="_blank">Xiaowei Zhou</a>.

My research interests lie in generative models, model-based RL, and 3D foundation models. Iâ€™d really appreciate the chance to exchange ideas with anyone who shares similar interests!
